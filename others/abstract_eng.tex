\section*{Abstract}

{
    The present document describes and compares the implementation of an \ac{IP} radio station build with QUIC over multicast and over 
    unicast for broadcasting live-streaming content. The main goal is to demostrate that the use of multicast is better in terms of scalability,
    energetic and economical one for broadcasting this type of content. The dificulties and advantages of using QUIC over Multicast (Draft QUIC
    over Multicast, Pardue and Hurst) are also being discussed as well as the managememnt of the Connection IDs and the use of \ac{RTP} and 
    \ac{RTCP} for upper layers and security.
