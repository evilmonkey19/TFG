\section*{Abstract}
{
    The present document describes and compares the implementation of a server dedicated for real-time broadcasting (TV, radio, etc)
    done with QUIC over Multicast technology and another done with QUIC unicast. The main goal is to prove that multicast is 
    better for distributing this type of content in terms of scalability and sustainability.
