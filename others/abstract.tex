\section*{Abstract}

{
    This document analyses the current implementations of QUIC protocol and the HTTP/3 mapping that facilitates the transfer
    of HTTP resources over multicast QUIC transport as its framing and packetisation layer. It shows the steps to create a radio station over HTTP in order to demostrate
    that a live-streaming over QUIC multicast is possible at the current moment. The benefits and withdraws of the current
    existing library (NGHQ\footnote{HTTP over Multicast QUIC Draft 07 - Sam Hurst, Richard Bradbury}) are explained.
